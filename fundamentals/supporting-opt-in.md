# Supporting Opt-In

To respect your user's privacy, you may wish to ask for the user's consent before allowing the SDK to use user-specific data for certain purposes. Currently, the SDK only allows users to opt into all purposes or no purposes, but in the future we hope to provide more granular control over specific purposes.

If the user opts into all purposes, the SDK will be allowed to perform the following tasks:

* Send data to and from Adobe's servers.
* Write privacy-sensitive cookies or web storage items.

If the user does not opt into all purposes, the SDK will not perform any of these tasks.

## Configuring Opt-In

To prevent the SDK from performing these tasks until the user opts in, pass `"optInEnabled": true` during SDK configuration as follows:

```javascript
alloy("configure", {
  "configId": "ebebf826-a01f-4458-8cec-ef61de241c93",
  "imsOrgId": "ADB3LETTERSANDNUMBERS@AdobeOrg",
  "optInEnabled": true
});
```

Once Opt-in is enabled, attempting to execute any commands that depend on user opt-in preferences (e.g., the `event` command) will result in the command being queued within the SDK. These commands will not be processed until you have communicated the user's opt-in preferences to the SDK.

At this point, you will likely wish to ask the user to opt in somewhere within your user interface. Once the user's preferences have been collected, communicate these preferences to the SDK.

## Communicating User Preferences

If the user opts into all purposes, execute the `optIn` command with the `purposes` option set to `all` as follows:

```javascript
alloy("optIn", {
  "purposes": "all"
});
```

Since the user has now opted into all purposes, the SDK will execute all previously queued commands. Future commands that depend on the user opting in will _not_ be queued and instead be promptly executed.

If the user chose _not_ to opt into any purpose, execute the `optIn` command with the `purposes` option set to `none` as follows:

```javascript
alloy("optIn", {
  "purposes": "none"
});
```  

Because the user chose to not opt into any purposes, promises that were returned from previously queued commands will be rejected. Future privacy-sensitive commands will return promises that are similarly rejected. For more information on handling or suppressing errors, please refer to [Executing Commands](executing-commands.md).

## Persistence of User Preferences

Once you have communicated user preferences to the SDK using the `optIn` command, the user's preferences will be saved to a cookie. The next time the user loads your website in the browser, the SDK will retrieve and use these persisted preferences. There is no need to execute the `optIn` command again, except to communicate a change in the user's preferences, which you may do at any time.
